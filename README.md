# Coffee-App

This application is my second application created for IOS using Swift. This challenged me as I have moved from JavaScript to
a More Object Orientated programming language. Through the creation of this app I have begun to grasp the concepts of OOP
and have made a working coffee app. 

## Features 

- Animated tab bar controller used for smooth transitions and faster loading speeds. 
- Transfer of functions between swift files in order to create a total.
- Targeted the badge Icon to show a counter which increased with drink purchases. 

## To do

- Add support for the removal of drinks from the basket by revealing the buttons when one or more of the same drink is added. 
- Add a food options tab and have both tabs update individually in relation to the badge on the tab bar. 
- Add coupon code functionality / deals in the basket section to reduce price.
